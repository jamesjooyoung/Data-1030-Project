# Predicting Student Performance

This repository contains the data used and code written to create an algorithm to predict student performance of students in mathematics classes in two schools in Portugal. This is a binary classification problem, where the target variable is the final grade a student receives, which is influenced by the features of this problem ranging from previous academic performance to family background.
